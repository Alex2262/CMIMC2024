% We want to achieve a pattern where both alice and bob find the given 1,
% then Alice will go back to the start, mark down y spots (y is the place where Bob's 1 is at)
% then for each mark, Alice will loop through x times with Bob moving right from the start


% Bob moves down first
0,0 3,_,_,D

% Here we achieve some funny alternating movement so that Alice and Bob can reach their 1's
% Note we cannot use 0,0 anymore, so we must alternate

% They also leave a trail of 2's
3,0 2,3,R,_
0,3 3,2,_,R

% Bob reaches his 1 first, so only Alice moves now (continue to leave the trail of 2)
3,1 2,_,R,_
0,1 2,_,R,_

% Alice reaches her 1 first, so only Bob moves now (continue to leave the trail of 2)
1,3 _,2,_,R
1,0 _,2,_,R

% Now they are both at their respective 1's
% We mark a 5 here for Alice, because it is a stopping marker for her loops
1,1 5,_,L,L

% After the previous command, they are now both on 2s. We move Alice to -1 coordinate first.
2,2 _,_,L,_

% Now that Alice is at -1 coordinate, she places a marker (4) at each coordinate from [-y, -1]
% Note that Bob ends up at -1 at the end of this
0,2 4,_,L,L

% At the end of that previous command, they will actually both reach the input 0,0
% So now we luckily have Bob move down 1 coordinate to the second row
% This leaves us to the input 3,0 where Alice will move right and place a 2, and have Bob place a 3
% Remember, to the right of Alice's 2 is all the markers (4).

% So now we arrive at the input 4,3.
% We only want Alice to move to the right here
4,3 _,_,R,_

% Once Alice moves back to coordinate 0, the input will be 2,3
% During the first iteration to the end, we actually do not move Bob at all since this would result in an extra
% bunch of numbers. We place (6) to make us move back to the left
2,3 6,_,R,_


2,0 6,1,R,R

% At the end of moving right from all these 2s, Alice reaches the stopping marker (5)
% This simply makes her go back left, and Bob places a (4) here.
5,3 _,4,L,_

% Note that later we can also reach this command with 5,0 , so it must be accounted for
5,0 _,4,L,_


% Now Alice travels back along the 6s, and places 2s, so she can loop back
6,4 2,_,L,_

% Once alice reaches the markers (4), she will replace one of the markers with a (5) to signal that it has been used
% And then, she will start moving back
4,4 5,0,R,_

% The rest proceeds as usual, until she encounters one of these original (4) marker that she has replaced as a (5)
% Here, we have the input 5,4
% Alice must move left to use up another marker. Meanwhile, she must place a 6 here so Alice can move back to the right
5,4 6,_,L,_

% Remember, as long as we encounter a 4, Bob's place will be set with a 0, so when we return from the replaced markers,
% we will return along the input 6,0 moving right. We replace these as 5s since we need to move along the left here
6,0 5,_,R,_

% Once all the markers (4) have been used up, we near the end of our program. Remember, to the left of all the markers
% was a random 2 we put down in Alice's row. This is very beneficial, as we can use the input 4,1 to have Bob
% place a 1 and move right. Bob still must place one more (1).
2,4 4,1,_,R

% Now, Bob places one more (1), and we go to the stopping condition.
4,0 2,1,_,_

% Stopping condition
2,1 _,_,_,_
